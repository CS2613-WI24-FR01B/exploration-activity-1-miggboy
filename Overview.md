# Pandas: Python Data Analysis Library

### What is Pandas?

Pandas, meaning **Pan**el **Da**ta Analysi**s**, is a widely-used open-source Python library for working with data [[ref]](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/pandas_intro.asp#:~:text=What%20is%20Pandas%3F,by%20Wes%20McKinney%20in%202008.).<br>


### Why use Pandas?

When it comes to data, Pandas does just about everything:

- **Data Importing**<br>
Pandas provides methods of importing large datasets in several formats [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/io.html). In my EA, I've chosen a simple CSV file, but Pandas supports a myriad of other formats. In-taking such a large dataset without Pandas, using the base Python File I/O methods, would be messy and hard to manage.

- **Data Manipulation**<br>
Pandas grants capabilities for filtering, sorting, and merging data [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/merging.html). In my EA, I use Pandas to filter out irrelevant movies from the dataset to create a DataFrame that acts as a view for the particular preferences the user has inputed.

- **Data Analysis**<br>
Pandas is also capable of descriptive statistics, data visualization, and time series analysis [[ref]](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/visualization.html). These features are beyond the scope of the program I've created, but they are still of note as they are among the key features that make Pandas so popular.
